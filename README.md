# Contact-Book
The objective of this project is to develop a simple yet efficient Contact Book Application using Python that allows users to store, manage, and organize contact information in a user-friendly graphical interface.
The Contact Book Application is a Python-based project designed to help users save, search, update, and delete contact details easily. It uses the Tkinter library to provide a graphical user interface (GUI), making it interactive and easy to use even for beginners.

Each contact stores important details such as Name, Phone Number, Email, and Address.
The program maintains a list of all contacts in memory and displays them in a structured format. Users can perform various operations through simple button clicks rather than using complex commands.

Key Features:
Add Contact:
Allows users to add a new contact by entering name, phone number, email, and address.

View Contacts:
Displays all the saved contacts in a list, showing names and phone numbers for quick reference.

Search Contact:
Users can find a specific contact by entering a name or phone number.

Update Contact:
Enables users to modify or correct existing contact details.

Delete Contact:
Provides an option to remove unwanted contacts from the list.

Clear Fields:
Clears the input fields to allow quick entry of new contact data.

Graphical User Interface:
Designed with Tkinter for an intuitive, clean, and responsive layout.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
GUI Library: Tkinter
Data Structures: Lists and Dictionaries (for storing contact data)

Learning Outcomes:
Through this project, I learned:
How to build a GUI application using Tkinter.
How to manage user input and perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
How to handle events and callbacks in a GUI environment.
How to structure and organize code for readability and scalability.



learning Outcomes: 
The Contact Book Application is a practical Python project that demonstrates the use of GUI development, data management, and user interaction handling. It provides a real-world example of how Python can be used to create desktop applications that are both functional and user-friendly.
